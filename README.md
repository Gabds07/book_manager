<h1>A Book Manager for Kindle Users! 📚⭐</h1>

<h2>This project was made to make it easier for Kindle users to save their books and know where they are stored on the computer (and see their size, if that helps).</h2>

Or if you just want to manage the books you want to transfer to your Kindle!

It's easy, here's how it works:

You basically send the books to the program and save them.

When you reopen the program and click "Carregar", they'll appear again:

You can also double click wherever you want in the book to open in it's directory!
